## Exploring Access to Safe and Affordable Drinking Water – Part A

This repository documents Part A (Week 1) of my integrated project focused on understanding and improving access to safe and affordable drinking water.
This phase centered on learning how to import, clean, explore, and interpret real-world datasets using Google Sheets.

📌 Project Overview

The purpose of Part A was to work hands-on with raw data, understand its structure, and prepare it for deeper analysis.
Instead of rushing into visuals or conclusions, this week was about laying a strong foundation by learning how to handle data the right way.

🔍 Key Activities

Imported multiple CSV files, including both comma-separated and semicolon-separated formats

Examined dataset structure and relationships to understand meaning and context

Created organized data views and visuals for easier exploration

Recorded a video tutorial demonstrating how to manage mixed-separator CSV files—an essential real-world skill

🎯 Project Goal

Not just to load data, but to understand it deeply, clean it properly, and prepare it in a way that enables meaningful questions to be asked—and answered.

🧠 What I Accomplished

Successfully accessed, loaded, and prepared data for analysis

Used formulas, aggregations, and summary statistics

Built visualizations that revealed useful patterns

Interpreted trends that connect directly to real-world water access challenges

These steps established the groundwork for more advanced analysis in the next phase.

## Exploring Access to Safe and Affordable Drinking Water – Part B

This repository contains Part B of my ongoing project analyzing real-world data related to access to safe and affordable drinking water.
After laying the foundation in Week 1, this phase focused on transforming raw data into analysis-ready information that can support meaningful insights.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of Week 2 was to take unstructured, inconsistent datasets and refine them using structured transformation techniques. This meant going beyond surface-level cleaning to ensure the data was accurate, reliable, and ready for deeper exploration.

This phase emphasized practical data preparation—the kind that underpins sound decision-making in real-world water accessibility challenges.

🔍 Key Activities

Data Formatting & Cleaning: Correcting inconsistencies, fixing errors, and structuring the dataset

Spreadsheet Transformation Functions: Using formulas to standardize, categorize, and prepare variables

Understanding Samples & Distributions: Exploring how the data behaves and what patterns it reveals

Trend Identification & Assumption Testing: Analyzing patterns to validate hypotheses

Revisiting Week 1 Concepts with greater precision—formulas, descriptive statistics, charts, and data imports

🧠 What I Achieved

By the end of Part B, I successfully transformed raw, unorganized records into refined, analysis-ready data by:

Applying cleaning and transformation techniques

Producing clearer structures for better interpretation

Enhancing the reliability of insights

Preparing the dataset for deeper analysis in the next phase

This refined dataset now serves as a strong foundation for more advanced analytical work in Part C.
