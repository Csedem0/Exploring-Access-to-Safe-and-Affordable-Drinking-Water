## Exploring Access to Safe and Affordable Drinking Water 1

As part of my integrated project on Access to Safe and Affordable Drinking Water, I explored how to effectively import, clean, and understand real-world datasets using Google Sheets.

This week, my focus was on:

Importing CSV files, including both comma-separated and semicolon-separated formats

Understanding the structure, meaning, and relationships within each dataset

Creating clear data views and visuals to reveal key patterns and insights

I also recorded a short video tutorial https://lnkd.in/ewts7Ftq demonstrating how to handle a comma- and semicolon-separated CSV file, a common real-world challenge in data projects.

Link to the video tutorial that summarised the project Part A https://lnkd.in/es5e-H6e

The goal wasn’t just to load data, but to truly understand it, to prepare it in a way that allows meaningful questions to be asked and answered.

I successfully:

Accessed and prepared data for analysis

Used formulas, aggregations, and summary statistics to explore the dataset

Created data visualizations that revealed valuable insights

Interpreted patterns that supported real-world decision-making

I’m looking forward to Part B of the project, where I’ll dive deeper into data analysis and visualization to uncover actionable insights for improving access to clean water.

💬 I’d love to hear your thoughts, how do you approach data preparation when working with diverse datasets?





## Exploring Access to Safe and Affordable Drinking Water 2

Building on last week’s foundation, this week I put theory into action, diving deeper into the data preparation process and learning how to transform and clean data to make it ready for meaningful analysis.

As part of my ongoing project on Access to Safe and Affordable Drinking Water, I completed the second phase: Transforming the Data.

This stage was all about improving data quality and accuracy, focusing on:

- Data formatting and cleaning

- Using spreadsheet functions to transform data

- Understanding samples and distributions

- Identifying trends and testing assumptions

I also revisited key Week 1 concepts such as data import, formulas, charts, and descriptive statistics, applying them this time with more precision and confidence.

By the end of Week 2, I successfully moved from raw, unstructured data to refined, reliable, and analysis-ready data, the kind that forms the backbone of accurate insights and informed decisions.
